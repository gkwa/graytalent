## Purpose

Learn how to accept a string from user using golang bubbletea project.

This example
https://github.com/charmbracelet/bubbletea/blob/master/examples%2Ftextinput%2Fmain.go

was not sufficient for me to learn how to accept textinput but searching github yeilds this project which works as expected.

This works fine:
```

```
